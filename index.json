Using bilateral data on cross-border portfolio asset and bank loan holdings for 58 economies from 2001-2015, I combine simultaneous equation estimation with standard instruments to disentangle the main drivers of bilateral output co-movement. I find that effects of financial integration depend on types of asset integration and reverse when country-level financial fragility, measured by indicators of financial stress, is high: In times of low financial fragility, greater stock market integration leads to less GDP co-movement. Greater bilateral bond/loan market integration increases co-movement. Increasing country-level financial fragility reverses the signs of all effects. Without controlling for country-level financial fragility, signs and magnitude of effects vary across time and geography. Opposite signs of stock and bond/loan integration effects across all specifications suggest that stock market integration acts as a buffer to global output co-movement effects induced by bond/loan market integration.","tags":["Output Co-Movement","Financial Integration","Portfolio Investment","Loan integration","Financial Crises"],"title":"International Financial Integration and Output Co-Movement","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553346000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553346000,"objectID":"e7b5b92936d737cc781be54d8866b5f1","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/t2m/t2m/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/t2m/t2m/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Theories and Methods in Macroeconomics (T2M)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539162000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539162000,"objectID":"176c2e02fbdf13f812050b9113ff911a","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/paris-macroeconometrics/parismacro/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/paris-macroeconometrics/parismacro/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"6th Workshop on Applied Macro-Econometrics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534748413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534748413,"objectID":"485caf87cea08fb09140479a9d21a66c","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/eea/eea/","publishdate":"2018-08-20T09:00:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/eea/eea/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"33rd Annual Congress of the European Economic Association","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534420213,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534420213,"objectID":"2f9a1c3e7883d27197f7e2ee7214c671","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/iwh-halle/iwh/","publishdate":"2018-08-16T13:50:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/iwh-halle/iwh/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"8th IWH/INFER Workshop on International Capital Flows and Macroprudential Stability","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528970413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528970413,"objectID":"315879b44f4b83c1af4d8bc0944b11c7","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/rimini/rimini/","publishdate":"2018-06-14T12:00:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rimini/rimini/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Rimini Conference in Economics and Finance","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528376413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528376413,"objectID":"392b2853b5d8ca34545fc8bd04b53642","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/cepii-paris/cepii/","publishdate":"2018-06-07T15:00:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cepii-paris/cepii/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"CEPII Research Seminar","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517475600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517475600,"objectID":"e4bc1bdfe2a4fb19ae9ddb5f0d8f8487","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/cesifo/cesifo/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cesifo/cesifo/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"1st CESifo EconPol Europe PhD Workshop - Economic and Fiscal Policy in Europe","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Paul Berenberg-Gossler","Henrik Enderlein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474840800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474840800,"objectID":"79960ee72063ecd97cbe16f008d11dc6","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/publication/financial-fragmentation/","publishdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/financial-fragmentation/","section":"publication","summary":"We  describe  differing  degrees  of  financial  market  integration  in the euro  area,  identifying  a  clear  pattern of  disintegration  on  the  aggregate  level,  as  well  as  in the  most  important  financial  markets,  after  the  euro  area  crisis.
