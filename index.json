To gauge for effects of financial integration on co-movement I propose a new instrumental variable strategy exploiting the fact that cross-border financial integration is organized in densely connected communities that are sparsely connected among each other. Applying the new instrument to the data shows that greater financial integration leads to less co-movement in normal times and contagion in crisis times. Contagion among the total sample stems form greater stock market integration, while contagion among advanced economies is additionally driven by the bond market integration channel. These results cast doubt on the business cycle smoothing role of equity market integration.","tags":["Output Co-Movement","Financial Integration","Portfolio Investment","Loan integration","Financial Crises"],"title":"International Financial Integration and Output Co-Movement","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553346000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"e7b5b92936d737cc781be54d8866b5f1","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/t2m/t2m/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/t2m/t2m/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Theories and Methods in Macroeconomics (T2M)","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539162000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"176c2e02fbdf13f812050b9113ff911a","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/paris-macroeconometrics/parismacro/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/paris-macroeconometrics/parismacro/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"6th Workshop on Applied Macro-Econometrics","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534748413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"485caf87cea08fb09140479a9d21a66c","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/eea/eea/","publishdate":"2018-08-20T09:00:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/eea/eea/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"33rd Annual Congress of the European Economic Association","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534420213,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"2f9a1c3e7883d27197f7e2ee7214c671","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/iwh-halle/iwh/","publishdate":"2018-08-16T13:50:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/iwh-halle/iwh/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"8th IWH/INFER Workshop on International Capital Flows and Macroprudential Stability","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528970413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"315879b44f4b83c1af4d8bc0944b11c7","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/rimini/rimini/","publishdate":"2018-06-14T12:00:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rimini/rimini/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Rimini Conference in Economics and Finance","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528376413,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"392b2853b5d8ca34545fc8bd04b53642","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/cepii-paris/cepii/","publishdate":"2018-06-07T15:00:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cepii-paris/cepii/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"CEPII Research Seminar","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517475600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"e4bc1bdfe2a4fb19ae9ddb5f0d8f8487","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/talk/cesifo/cesifo/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cesifo/cesifo/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"1st CESifo EconPol Europe PhD Workshop - Economic and Fiscal Policy in Europe","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Paul Berenberg-Gossler","Henrik Enderlein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474840800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566392951,"objectID":"79960ee72063ecd97cbe16f008d11dc6","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/publication/financial-fragmentation/","publishdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/financial-fragmentation/","section":"publication","summary":"We  describe  differing  degrees  of  financial  market  integration  in the euro  area,  identifying  a  clear  pattern of  disintegration  on  the  aggregate  level,  as  well  as  in the  most  important  financial  markets,  after  the  euro  area  crisis.
