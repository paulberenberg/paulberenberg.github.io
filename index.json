Exploiting panel data on bilateral portfolio holdings from 29 advanced economies covering 17 years, I filter idiosyncratic and common shock drivers of synchronization. I show that portfolio investment and synchronization correlate negatively in response to common shocks, consistent with previous results and suggesting flight to safety effects. However, they correlate positively in response to idiosyncratic shocks, suggesting that output smoothing takes place. This result is robust to controlling for bank loan integration. The evidence suggests that  if we want to find remedies for asymmetric business cycles, we need to take asset specific effects into account.","tags":["Output Co-Movement","Financial Integration","Portfolio Investment","Loan integration","Financial Crises"],"title":"International Portfolio Investment Integration and Business Cycle Synchronization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Berenberg-Gossler","Gonçalo Pina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609632219,"objectID":"b057bc5f579dd349167e06419d10ca54","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/publication/conference-paper3/","publishdate":"2020-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper3/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper shows that regulatory actions against misconduct in the financial industry are driven by business cycles. Using text mining techniques, we construct a new database of regulatory actions based on US investment advisor filings distinguishing between state, federal, and self-organized regulators. Our data cover 9,750 regulatory actions and fines across 49 states over the 1990-2019 period. We then show that the number of regulatory actions responds to the business cycle with a lag. It is consistently lower following economic boom periods and higher following busts. To establish causal evidence, we combine our data with information on 24 million federally administered military contracts that affect state-level business cycles. Exploiting these contracts, we find that after a positive state-level output shock, regulatory actions decrease up to 60 months at the state regulatory level, but increase at the federal-level. Measures based on regulatory fines mirror this pattern. Our findings suggest that state-level regulatory actions are pro-cyclical, and federal-level regulatory actions are counter-cyclical, suggesting that different levels of regulatory agencies respond differently to business cycles.","tags":[],"title":"Financial Regulatory Actions over the
