So standen aggressive Interventionen im Zentrum von Trumps Handelspolitik. Ihm ging es vor allem darum, Produktionsstätten und Arbeitsplätze, die ins Ausland verlagert wurden, wieder zurück in die USA zu holen und Handelsbilanzdefizite zu senken. Es zeigt sich aber, dass die zahlreichen handelspolitischen Interventionen nur begrenzt Spuren in den Handelsströmen mit den wichtigsten Partnern hinterlassen haben. Lediglich beim Handel mit China ging das Defizit kurzzeitig etwas zurück. Die 2018 eingeführten Importzölle auf chinesische Güter haben auch dazu geführt, dass das verarbeitende US-Gewerbe, das auf Importe aus China als Vorleistungen angewiesen ist, dadurch mit höheren Produktionskosten zu kämpfen hat. Auch für den neuen US-Präsidenten Joe Biden ist China der größte Konkurrent im Welthandel. Während Trump allerdings auf Alleingänge setzte, beabsichtigt Biden, internationale Allianzen zu suchen, um die Verhandlungsposition gegenüber China zu verbessern. Diese Chance sollte die Europäische Union rechtzeitig ergreifen.","tags":["Policy","Financial Fragmentation","Financial Crises"],"title":"Trumps protektionistische Handelspolitik hat ihre Ziele verfehlt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Berenberg-Gossler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603576800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592511215,"objectID":"69425fb10d4db090cfbd46854715582c","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/publication/conference-paper/","publishdate":"2020-10-25T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper argues that the correlation of cross-border portfolio investment integration with business cycle synchronization is conditional on different types of shocks. Exploiting panel data on bilateral portfolio holdings from 29 advanced economies covering 17 years, I filter idiosyncratic and common shock drivers of synchronization. I show that portfolio investment and synchronization correlate negatively in response to common shocks, consistent with previous results and suggesting flight to safety effects. However, they correlate positively in response to idiosyncratic shocks, suggesting that output smoothing takes place. This result is robust to controlling for bank loan integration. The evidence suggests that  if we want to find remedies for asymmetric business cycles, we need to take asset specific effects into account.","tags":["Output Co-Movement","Financial Integration","Portfolio Investment","Loan integration","Financial Crises"],"title":"International Portfolio Investment Integration and Business Cycle Synchronization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Berenberg-Gossler","Gonçalo Pina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603144800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592511215,"objectID":"b057bc5f579dd349167e06419d10ca54","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/publication/conference-paper3/","publishdate":"2020-10-20T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper3/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper shows that regulatory actions against misconduct in the financial industry are driven by business cycles. Using text mining techniques, we construct a new database of regulatory actions based on US investment advisor filings distinguishing between state, federal, and self-organized regulators. Our data cover 9,750 regulatory actions and fines across 49 states over the 1990-2019 period. We then show that the number of regulatory actions responds to the business cycle with a lag. It is consistently lower following economic boom periods and higher following busts. To establish causal evidence, we combine our data with information on 24 million federally administered military contracts that affect state-level business cycles. Exploiting these contracts, we find that after a positive state-level output shock, regulatory actions decrease up to 60 months at the state regulatory level, but increase at the federal-level. Measures based on regulatory fines mirror this pattern. Our findings suggest that state-level regulatory actions are pro-cyclical, and federal-level regulatory actions are counter-cyclical, suggesting that different levels of regulatory agencies respond differently to business cycles.","tags":[],"title":"Financial Regulatory Actions over the Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Berenberg-Gossler","Gonçalo Pina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1602280800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592511215,"objectID":"d6e6088f81e1b2f425d8eb99ae5a9e79","permalink":"https://paulberenberg.github.io/publication/conference-paper2/","publishdate":"2020-10-10T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper2/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper shows that elections decrease regulatory actions against misconduct in the financial industry. In the United States, regulation of financial misconduct is carried out by three types of regulators: federal, state, and self-regulatory. Most state-level financial regulators are directly appointed by state governors. We analyze a new database on regulatory actions covering 49 US states from 1990 until 2019, to assess whether state-level electoral incentives affect regulatory activity. Exploiting exogenous electoral cycles of US gubernatorial elections, we find causal evidence that state-level financial regulators reduce regulatory activity starting five months before gubernatorial election events. This slump occurs even earlier if elections are contested. Federal and self-regulatory regulators do not punish less in response to gubernatorial elections, suggesting a direct link between gubernatorial elections and state regulators. Using data on the average duration of preparation for each case, we show that there is a significant rush to finish regulatory actions up to five months prior to gubernatorial elections. We find no evidence for a catch-up effect after gubernatorial election events. These results underscore the persistence of electoral cycles in financial regulation.","tags":[],"title":"Elections decrease Financial Regulatory Activity: Evidence from Investment Adviser
